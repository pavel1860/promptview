# Description
this application is a framework for building agents. it uses a React like components called blocks
in the [block2.py](mdc:promptview/prompt/block2.py) file, to dynamically build prompts.

# Archtecture
## Blocks
blocks are the basic building blocks of the prompt

## execution wrappers
there are 2 components that acts as controllers for the execution.
prompt - the parallel of a function, executes llm calls
agent - parallel of a generator, executes prompts in a loop until it gets the answer.

both of them are used as decorators, and provide tracing capability and inject dependencies.

## Message Log
- the message log is an event source like database that stores the communication with the agent.
- the message log is appending messages for every output of the llm or input from the user.
- the message log can create branches, to test out alternative implementations.

# API
the application gives ability to connect external UI for interacting with the chat agent.
